We used react - so it works on all OS

Instruction to run the application:
* npm install
* yarn install
* npm install react-slider
* npm install react-notifications-component
* npm install react-scripts
* npm install styled-components
* npm install react-icons
* npm start

ps.When testing the timer test it by setting the time to one minute so that you be notified when the timer goes off with a sound and alert 

We have added settings which allows you to set the time you would like the task to be completed by. 
Type the task
